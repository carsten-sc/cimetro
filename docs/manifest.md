## Cimetro Carsten's simulation of a metropolis

## Why this project?

### ✅ Why Rust?

* Memory safety without a garbage collector
* Zero-cost abstractions → no performance impact due to modern syntax
* Concurrency without race conditions → perfect for multithreading
* Modern toolchain → Cargo, Clippy, Rustfmt, etc.
* Growing game development community → Bevy, WGPU, Rapier (physics), etc.

### ✅ Why Bevy Engine (Rust)

* Open source, under the MIT/Apache 2.0 license
* Rust-based, meaning memory-safe, high-performance, and modern
* Uses an Entity Component System (ECS) → perfect for simulations
* Supports 2D & 3D, GPU compute, custom shaders, hot reloading
* Very actively developed, with a growing community.
